My first color match was a bit orange so I repurchased in a different shade. I love it that much. The consistency is so light but it has good coverage! You should build up the coverage opposed to applying a ton of product at once.\\', \\'My skin tone is very neutral/yellow and some days leans very neutral/olive. Finding good neutral foundations at the drugstore is not always easy as most run warm yellow or pink. The shade Nude is an AMAZING choice for olive or neutral olive skin tones! I feel like I match my body perfect. Thanks for looking out NYX!!!!\\', \"This is one of my favs on the drug store end! I have tons of different foundations including a few high end but this seems to always be my go to. I have combo skin and it I usually set it with either airspun or sacha buttercup setting powder and it looks so pretty!! I read a comment about it looking patchy with the elf camo concealer and I have to admit I didn\\'t like that concealer AT ALL. It made mine look patchy too so I prefer either neutrogena or colour pop hyaluronic concealer and it all blends so nicely! I use the color cappuccino for reference\", \\'I tried this foundation on a whim and fell in love. I have always struggled to find foundations that work for me. This one, while not perfect, is amazing!! Make sure you have a good primer to use with it!!\\', \"I typically use the nars sheer glow but I kept hearing good things about the NYX born to glow. I was kind of skeptical because a lot of drug store foundations are to matte for my skin and my skin type is dry. When I bought this I was so shocked how well and how quick it dried! I love that it stayed all day, didnt smell like anything which was good for me & it didn\\'t crease or didn\\'t look greasy, instead it gives you a natural flawless look. If you have dry skin, this is a good option!\", \\'I found my perfect shade in this foundation, and the formula is great for my dry skin.  I set my oily T-zone with a mattifying powder, and Im good to go!\\', \\'Use daily.\\', \\'It turned my entire face orange. It was thick, greasy,  and overall bad.\\', \"This worked good for my dry skin. I\\'d recommend.\", \"I have very very dry skin right now, and this foundation just exaggerated every crease and fine line I have, and looked sooo cakey on my dry spots, especially around my mouth. On my cheeks where I\\'m not as dry, it looks beautiful so if you don\\'t have dry skin this might work for you. I\\'m so bummed because it was a really great color match too, but oh well.\", \"This foundation is so beautiful. It does leave a lovely radiant, glow finish. It\\'s not patchy and blends seamlessly. Easy to build. I have dry skin with rosacea and this was a gorgeous finish to my skin and did not show texture. I was able to layer contour blush and highlight without it coming off. And I lightly dusted with powder without removing the lovely glow. Hopefully this foundation will be around for a long time bc I don\\'t think I\\'ll find another one as good and I really want to try the concealer and any other products in this line.\", \\'I wear foundation because of my uneven, blotchy skin and this is great for that. Seemed to last all day, impressed for the price!\\', \"not sure if it was the e.l.f hydrating camo concealer or this but it gave my t-zone a patchy area:/ I loved the way it felt on my skin. and I have oily skin for reference , it left me with such a dewy look. I only wanted to try this cause it\\'s a dupe for the Fenty foundation.\", \\'this is really runny and doesnt have much coverage at all. ive been looking to replace my foundation that was discontinued and this was no match to that\\', \\'Omg! This foundation is fully covered and awesome ❤️\\', \"This foundation is great and the price is even better such a natural look you don\\'t need much unless that\\'s what you like!! I brought the shade deep/ cool and deep walnut both are cool undertone.. what\\'s weird is they are almost identical in shade walnut is a tad darker!!! I HIGHLIGHTED with Nyx concealer In cappuccino IT BLENDED PERFECT NOT THAT BRIGHT BRIGHT WEIRD LOOK LIKE YOU TRYING TO HARD!!! GREAT COMBINATION FOR ME!!! Wish we could insert Pics\", \"This foundation is beautiful; I got it on a whim to match my fall/winter skin since my summer shades are now too dark. It\\'s stunning. There are so many shades, I landed on Golden Honey and it\\'s PERFECT. The formulation is a little watery, and the finish is extremely radiant, so I probably wouldn\\'t recommend if your skin is already oily. I, however, and painfully dry skin. This foundation is really hydrating. Highly recommend.\", \"When I\\'m in a pinch and not buying $40+ foundation this is my go to for a supple and full coverage budget friendly liquid foundation! I use a makeup sponge with it and it covers all my imperfections and dark acne spots really well. Nyx\\'s other born to glow products are gems as well and pair nicely :)\", \"This foundation is smooth and gives great medium coverage. It\\'s buildable without looking cakey. I ended up putting too much on in one layer, which looked cakey, so thin layers are best with this formula. I do like how smooth and easy to blend the formula is. I\\'ve used a buffer brush and my hands, both look great!\", \"This was far heavier than I was hoping, and it really emphasized the pores on my chin. I look better without makeup than with this. It made me look like I was trying to cover up my freckles, which is not my goal. I also wouldn\\'t call this radiant. It looked pretty matte and cakey on my skin. Even though the overall shade range is great, I am very fair, and the shades in that range are too yellow in tone for me.\", \"I love this it\\'s so smoothing and natural looking yet gives you coverage it\\'s my everyday fav ! So beautiful on the skin and long wearing !\", \"This was pretty good especially at such a good price! It does have good staying power and a nice glow. You have to be careful because it\\'s kinda watery and cones out fast. Good coverage.\", \"This is by far my favorite foundation I just tried today! The formula is very creamy and easily blends with a beauty blender. The foundation doesn\\'t appear cake-y nor bumpy like most issues with foundations. It\\'s a product that can easily be buildable if you want a more full coverage look. Only thing is I wish the product didn\\'t run out so fast!\", \\'I have naturally dry skin and this foundation gives a lovely and lively glow to my face.

I love that it is not cakey and you end up with a beautiful glow.\\', \"Fantastic coverage but I have a problem free skin. The coverage shocked me in a good way. I got the shade vanilla and I love it. I use a brush to apply this.  I do not need coverage so I need a little of this foundation. The finish is great radiant but not too greasy and it doesn\\'t move around. I can\\'t comment on the lasting effect of this because I don\\'t wear foundation that long, just during work a little. I\\'m 33 years old with normal skin and no texture.\", \\'I tried this foundation on a day I didn\\\\\\'t care about my makeup because I am sooo picky about my foundation. I like full coverage, no cake, not heavy, etc. I bought this because I saw good reviews and it was on sale. I tried it and kept asking my friends, \"do you like my foundation?\" because I was shook at how I liked it. It;s definitely perfect for an everyday foundation so I can save my expensive foundation for night time festivities.\\', \"I\\'m use to wearing the expensive foundation but because of corona and having to wear these mask I don\\'t wanna waste my good foundation.\", \"This isn\\'t a GREAT foundation but it also isn\\'t bad. I don\\'t think I would wear this on it\\'s own just simply because it\\'s pretty light coverage and it transfers easily even after setting with powder and setting spray. I have found that I LOVE the look I get when I mix this with my urban decay stay naked. Both foundations are a super lightweight watery consistency so they go on amazing but the stay naked has more coverage and staying power so it helps the nyx foundation a lot. I also get my perfect shade mixing the two so that\\'s a plus. I\\'ll use this up and depending on how many foundations I have at the time I\\'ll buy it again to mix with my stay naked since I do love the look it gives.

I returned it.\\', \\'I was using the Maybelline 24Hr SuperStay for its full coverage, love it, but I did notice a dry patch, never had seen that before. So I would mix it with my beloved No 7 Lift & Luminate. All was well but still my one pesky age spot showed. Then I tried the NYX Born to Glow by itself over a cheap primer and the age spot was covered, my dry skin did not look overly dewy, just luminous. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that oddly sometimes the spot does show thru, so then I use it with the Maybelline 24HrSuperStay. Dries down well, no tackiness, able to pick the right shade after watching a few YT videos. Highly recommend esply for us older gals!\\', \\'Color is off\\', \"I love this foundation!\\'\", \\'Product goes on smooth and is buildable. I am not sure it is necessary \"glow\" worthy. It worked well with my other product also.\\', \\'I had recently purchased the Maybelline 24HR Super-Stay fdtn which is very full coverage and yet it showed up some dry patches that I didnt know I had (mature woman here) and did not cover my one shrinking age spot ( dru fast and it keeps getting paler, yay!). I used that with my beloved No7 Lift and Luminate which helps improve my skin, makes the Maybellline look more luminous aka less dry but does not cover the age spot. This one by NYX? Does all of the above: full coverage even of that age spot, luminous coverage as well, no dry patches to be seen. Somehow I managed to pick the right shade online which for me is Vanilla. The NYX website is not helpful on shades but YT reviewers are lol tho I had to watch sooo many. I hear it is not great for oily skin but I have dry skin so for me this is a huge win and the price is great!\\', \"Nice light to medium coverage. I bought shade  nude and it\\'s a bit dark, but it blends in fine. Works well over sunscreen so long as you let SPF dry down first. Not particularly glowy or matte either. I set with very light powder.\", \\'First off, this foundation is extremely runny/thin. It has very little coverage but the finish is beautiful. This is definitely not a long wearing/full coverage product. I would recommend this to normal-dry skin who want light coverage and a dewy finish.

It can form dry patches you didn\\'t even realize you had.\", \\'This foundation does transfer easily onto clothes, but it looks AMAZING on skin\\', \\'This is great for folks who want that youthful glow but are naturally more shiny and don\\\\\\'t want their makeup sliding off. I have quite normal skin slightly leaning combo and this is the perfect consistency for me. It leaves my skin very close to its natural texture but obviously perfected. For me, it kinda has that soft, natural beauty, movie \"no makeup\" teenager skin. Idk how to describe it. Flawless, Chloe Grace Moretz, peach fuzzy young skin. Haha\\', \"this is a great foundation. gives a healthy glow. it\\'s a suuuuuper runny formula. i have to set this with a powder. if you change your shirt or your boo gives you a kiss, it will transfer FYI. looks super healthy! great shade range as well.\", \"I picked the color Pale as I am very light with warm undertones. The color itself was a good match however, the product was a joke. It was basically yellow water. I tried applying the makeup on bare skin or with various products underneath to see if that would make a difference. I shook the bottle. Applied with fingers and sponge blender. Nothing made this foundation work. It was splotchy and barely did anything except make the texture of my face look strange. I\\'m shocked by how watery it is; I usually like this brand\\'s products. I don\\'t know if I got a bad batch but this was a total waste of money.\", \"I tried mixing this with my moisturizer and it\\'s much better.... thought it would be more transparent\", \\'Natural finish and great coverage! I love the concealer too!\\', \"All day wear with a full coverage that\\'s breathable. It looks natural and gives you a healthy glow as if your skin is flawless. \\\\n\\\\n I\\'m definitely switching from my Lancome Full coverage foundation to Nyx.\\\\n\\\\n I bought the concealer to go with it and it\\'s perfect. I set both with a setting powder & it lasted all day. No separation or cracking.\", \\'The shade nude was a perfect match and didnt oxidize at all. Longwearing and the medium coverage is covers acne scars while letting my skin breath. I can put cream blush and contour over it without the foundation being disturbed. My only issue is that i need to have moisturizer under or else itll emphasize dry spots but its not a deal breaker.\\', \"I tried it on a whim. I bought nutmeg and warm honey. Nutmeg is a shade too dark and warm honey is a shade too light, so I mix them and it\\'s perfect. I am going to try cinnamon next. To me it compares very well to my Fenty foundation.\", \"Pros: goes on smoothly, warms to my skin tone (oxidizes), light-weight feel, buildable coverage, convenient tube container and looks very natural vs the Can\\'t Stop Don\\'t Stop\\\\n\\\\nCons: it rubs off very easily. If you need coverage, you\\'ll need to carry this with you because one swipe of your finger and it\\'s off your face and transferring wherever your fingers touch. If you have oily skin like me, this makeup won\\'t stay in place all day. You\\'ll need touch ups and setting powder 😑\", \\'My favorite foundation of all time\\', \"I love this foundation I have super dry skin which is new for me. I was used to oil but I guess body\\'s change. This foundation has been my go to since.\", \"I would say when it is sheer to medium coverage that seems to be good when first buying it but would not buy it again. Doesn\\'t last long and separates after a long wear, its ok for 3 to 5 hours but I would not plan to wear it out to a party.\", \"For reference i have combination,acne prone skin and have medium tan skin with yellow/olive undertone. pros about this foundation are that it did not break me out and the coverage is buildable. The cons are that it applies splotchy when i use a sponge,it doesn\\'t blend well, it\\'s too thick and the yellow/olive shades are not great. i couldn\\'t find my perfect match so i went with true beige and its orange..\", \"I\\'m 35 with combination skin and I want hesitant about purchasing this, but I wanted a cheaper foundation to wear on the weekends. WOW just wow, the coverage is medium and goes on best with a dry beauty blender. I used the ELF poreless putty primer on my forehead and the Tarte hydrating primer on the rest of my face prior to applying the foundation. l used the Tarte loose translucent powder to set it and some setting spray and it lasted 12 hours. I had minor cracking around my lip mid-day but I\\'m 35 so it\\'s normal at my age to start seeing the fine lines. I really recommend this foundation and I will be buying a few backups!\", \"I would love the product it\\'s just the wrong color\", \\'Love NYX products\\', \"Feels great on the skin.

I felt like I was wearing baby oil or vaseline. This did not work out for me at all.\", \"I have been wanting to try this and had to pick my shade using help from the NYX website due to quarantine. I love that they have the product for different skin tones. I ended up with a neutral and at first though it was too yellow but after blending it on my skin it was the perfect color. It\\'s a thinner consistency that I expected but it covered well without looking too heavy. I think this is my new go to!\", \\'Love it\\', \"I thought this would be great because Gemma on the Pampered Wolf channel raves about this foundation and I usually love her recommendations. BUT, this just did not work for me. Slides around then looks cakey and breaks up after just a few hours.  I just don\\'t get it.\", \"This foundation is great and overs a good shade range. It does show some fine lines but it\\'s nothing a little powder can\\'t do.\", \"I have dry skin but this looks flawless on my face. I\\'ve been trying different foundations but none of them compare to how this one looks and lasts.\", \"I have worn this for 2 weeks now and I officially love it! I am a makeup hoarder and have about 40 other foundations but this is my top dog. It ticks all my boxes. It\\'s medium coverage, hydrating, luminous but not overboard, long lasting, and it\\'s not a million dollars, and most importantly, doesn\\'t emphasize any wrinkles or lines on my 43 year old face. I use the matching concealer and it\\'s a great combo.\", \"I bought two different shades to try after getting a sample card with a previous purchase and one was a winner! I have annoyingly dry skin that repels and creases randomly, and this is working well! I set it with a hydrating powder on a beauty blender. My only complaint is it doesn\\'t cover veins or dark spots well and trying to build coverage resulted in splotches.\", \\'I loved the shade range and found one pretty close to my skin tone but it sat very weird on my skin. Directly after application i saw how it accentuated my dry spots and texture. It broke up on my chin and nose and all my dry portions of my face. Disappointing but it could always work for others\\', \\'Very easy to use and works great\\', \\'The foundation wore well and was just the right amount of glow. Just a hint.... more of a soft focus... I have dry skin so this brought a much needed oomph.... great value!\\', \\'despite having combo skin, this sits beautifully on my skin and leaves it looking dewy, healthy, and gorgeous\\', \\'I never thought this would be one of my top favorite foundations but it is. it gives a dewy radiant finish without being too heavy. Beautiful and flawless! I recommend using it with the glow primer.\\', \\'I wore this to work (10 hr shift) and by the end of my shift I still had it on without it creasing! My skin still looked beautiful. I like that it looks natural and not \"cakey\" on the skin. I always wear primer under my foundation to make my skin look nice. If you\\\\\\'re looking for a foundation that lasts long, looks natural, isn\\\\\\'t expensive, then this is the right one for you! I\\', \"It\\'s a good medium coverage everyday foundation for me. The color beige is a great match. The finish in my opinion is more satin and natural but not dewy. I got this foundation to even my skintone for easy makeup days. I have oily skin, so I knew what I was getting into when I bought it. It\\'s not long wearing on me even though I set with powder. I get a good 6-7 hrs before the foundation starts to break up and disappear on my face. My only issue is with the packaging. For a runny foundation I think a bottle with pump would have been better.\", \\'Never disappointed with NYX.  I e several.products and love them all.  This foundation coverage is perfect for me and so is the price.\\', \\'I was so excited when i finally found this foundation.\\\\nGreat coverage,light weight,a little glowy but not oily,no sent, and range of colors.The only reason i dont give it five starts the packaging i wish it had a pump for the price.\\', \\'This is my go-to daily foundation.  I like a dewy, smooth look to my skin.  This does so with out having to wear a ton to have good coverage.  Dries down very similarly to the shade and stays put with and without a setting powder.\\', \"I watched reviews before I purchased and was intrigued. I was so pleased at this foundation! It\\'s a light-medium coverage, and is buildable. I only use one coat... I like my skin to peek through! I usually wear natural beige in everything, but the shade I chose for this was the medium olive because it was definitely more neutral than yellow, but not SO yellow as the next fit, which was buff.  Matching was a little tricky. \\\\nStaying power was actually very good! I lightly set with Laura Mercier candle glow powder. Did not crease in forehead lines or around the nose or mouth. It\\'s radiant without getting shiny and didn\\'t accentuate things like the crevices around the nose where some glowy foundations can betray me at. \\\\nReally a winner!\", \"With the correct tool for application, this foundation is amazing! It has great coverage, and depending on the right brush or sponge, doesn\\'t break up throughout the day. I\\'ve been using this since January with different products under and over it, and I think it\\'s great. Holds up far better than the Fenty foundation did. Was nervous to try, but I\\'m pleasantly pleased!\", \\'Seriously, this is amazing!  Not only is the price perfect but so was my coverage.\\', \\'I was very disappointed in this product. I was hoping for a dewy finish, but it appears very matte and dry. It cracks VERY easy, even with primer under and setting spray afterwards. I have worn it for three days now and it keeps turning out the same.\\', \"I\\'ve been on the hunt for a hydrating light-to-medium tinted moisturizer or foundation for day-to-day use. While the shade match was great and looked nice and luminous from afar, it looked like it sat on my skin and never really meshed with my skin and made my dry skin look textured, when texture isn\\'t an issue for me. It also always came out streaky whenever I used a brush to apply it, most likely because it feels like a lotion when you put it on. but it\\'s typically my preferred method for foundation application. Using a beauty sponge is the only way I liked the finish. If you did the whole process of priming and setting, it could look really nice if you took the extra steps to help it set better on the skin. But for something to just slap on for simpler day to day application, it\\'s not worth taking those extra steps. I\\'d rather just reach for another foundation.\", \"I\\'ve used several foundations over the years high end, mid range and drug store brands. I decided to give this one a try after reading about it a d standing in Ultra scouring the store for quite some time. Inky bought 1 tube of foundation and concealer because I wasn\\'t sure if I\\'d like it.  My skin is more of an olive undertone and I\\'m dark skinned so I picked Walnut and I loved how smoothly it went on! Not cakey at all, it lasted all day. I didn\\'t have any issues or problems with it getting on my clothes or shirt or collar of my shirt as I did with other brands. I\\'ve received many compliments on my face since switching from the high end brand too. I\\'m very pleased with it. \\\\n\\\\nI purchased my first tube about 2 months ago of foundation and am still using that tube but I went out and bought 4 more. The concealer goes much more quickly in my opinion, so I did purchase 6 at a time of the concealer on my return trip to Ulta. \\\\n\\\\nI didn\\'t realize until I read a review that you should use a matte finishing spray? I bought Urban Decay brand which is not a matte spray that works rather well.\\\\n\\\\nI will continue to use this foundation because I love the coverage, the glow color .watch and cost!\", \"Let\\'s start with the positives. This is an affordable foundation with nice, buildable coverage. It has a beautiful dewy finish. I don\\'t like the dewy look on me, but with this product I don\\'t mind. This goes great with the concealer and is very easy to blend. Let\\'s look at the cons. I use the concealer too, and they both made me break out. So might not be suitable for sensitive skin. The bottle is just a normal unscrew the cap squeeze bottle, but it\\'s hard to use with such a runny product. Even with the use of primer and setting powder, one wrong move and the foundation comes right off. Overall it has a beautiful finish and easy application.\", \\'Switched to Clinique bc this broke me out\\', \"Seriously, this product is amazing! I love it! I accidentally bought a color that was a bit too dark; my own fault. But nonetheless, this product looks so gorgeous on the skin!

Definitely would recommend!\\\\n\\\\nXoxo, \\\\n     Gossip girl 💋\", \"I love this foundation!! I am a full coverage, glow to the heavens, paint my face queen!! I have no issues spending 50 dollars on a foundation but lately I\\'ve been exploring the more affordable side of ulta and this is a hit!! I color matched this to my fav IT cosmetics shade and gave it a spin and found the coverage a perfect dupe just a little more hydrating. I get compliments on my makeup everytime i wear this product and it stays glowy and natural looking through my whole 10 hour shift! Try this out! It blends easily, sets well with both expensive and affordable powders, and moves with your skin!!!\", \"Every drugstore foundation I\\'ve tried is either too cakey or the shades are not a good match for me. This NYX Born to Glow foundation is awesome. The formulation itself is light, not very heavy. On myself it offers light to medium coverage. I did find it to be buildable. It is dewy, but not overwhelmingly so. Biggest con is that in the heat when you sweat it doesn\\'t seem long lasting. However, the thing is when it runs off it actually looks ok. Sometimes when foundations wear off it looks terrible, but your face can wear off in this and still look decent with a touch up.\", \\'I love how it covers\\', \"I love the way this looks on, beige is my perfect match, and it feels great...BUT it slides right off! Like no matter what spray and primer I use it doesn\\'t help and already messed up 2 pieces of clothes in my 1st week using it!\", \"I bought this and used it twice before tossing it. I really wanted to love it so so bad but it wasn\\'t there for me. It looked great when i first put it on and after maybe 30 minutes is see the foundation start to crack.

I just couldn\\'t get it to work.\", \"I have pretty dry skin that drinks up most foundations and leaves my skin looking super matte and dry. This foundation is INCREDIBLE. It leaves such a beautiful healthy finish. It\\'s super light going on, and I can barely feel it. Coverage is great for a dewy foundation. It reminds me of Korean foundations I\\'ve tried because of how soft the finish is—I\\'ve never had an American foundation have such a healthy finish. It\\'s not sticky and dries down beautifully. This is especially important because I live in a desert climate.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have dry skin and you need extra coverage, I can\\'t recommend this enough.\", \"Perfect shade match!

As a pale lady, I find it difficult to find a light shade with a neutral/warm undertone without being too dark or oxidizing. I like this a lot but because it has a satin finish I find I get really oily about three to four hours into wearing it. Still a great product, though.\\', \"This is my absolute favorite foundation of all time now I will use nothing but this! I love how it makes me skin look and conceals and stays on all day! I don\\'t use a primer at all and it\\'s beautiful on my skin. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear and not to mention how it photographs BEAUTIFUL I look like a glowing goddess. I did not see the problem of oxidizing and the color matched me well. I got marched in store and they did a good job!\", \\'Nice coverage and glow. Oxidized within an hour of application, giving my face an orange tint. It was a nice product, so I may try a lighter shade to see if it improves the look.\\', \"This is my first NYX foundation, and I really wanted to love this, but it\\'s not as good as I hoped. The shade I picked (Beige) was a perfect match, which was great. It has a slightly thin consistency and it applies easily and evenly, best if you use a sponge. The coverage is light-medium, which I\\'m fine with since besides a little redness which I don\\'t mind peeking out a bit, my skin is pretty good and considering I\\'m nearing my 40\\'s, I feel the less products on my face, the better to keep it in good shape LOL. However, that\\'s where the pros end. After a while, I noticed that my pores were super visible around my cheeks and it started getting cakey around my forehead and between my eyes a lot faster than any other foundation I regularly use. I tried it with ELF Poreless Putty Primer and Touch In Sol No Poreblem primer and slightly set it with Pretty Vulgar The Powder Room setting powder, yet I got the same results with all of them. Also, it is not glowy at all, in fact it\\'s borderline matte.

Perfect for an everyday look. I used on top of a full coverage concealer to cover pimples or dark circles under my eyes. Best used to brighten and for glowy skin, even after using setting powder.

The foundation will break apart and become very patchy, almost like I took a cotton ball and blotted away some of the makeup. When it does this the lighter pigments seem to collect around my pores and it looks like little white dots on my face.

On dry parts, though, it looked flaky even after exfoliating and moisturizing really well before application.

It leaves behind a dewy finish and feels very hydrating! It also comes with a pretty good amount inside the bottle. A little does go a long way!\\', \\'I received this complimentary. I love everything about it, except I can feel it on my face, unlike other makeup brands that blend into your skin.\\', \\'I enjoy that I can build up this foundation in layers. One layers for light coverage and added layers for a fuller coverage and a more polished look.\\', \\'I used this product for a party and it looked good in all my photos.\\', \"I really like this foundation. It doesn\\'t feel heavy on my combination skin and didn\\'t break me out. It was easy to apply and has build able medium coverage. It is long wearing and it didn\\'t look cakey after wearing all day.

I would recommend to anyone looking for a good inexpensive foundation.\", \"I received this product for free to review. With that being said I have purchased Nyx\\'s total control foundation in the past and it has been one of my favorite low/mid priced foundations. I think these foundations are very similar but between the two I think I would say this new born to glow formula is a big step up. Both foundations are pretty liquidy in texture which doesn\\'t really bother me but it might not bother some. This foundation has a slightly quicker dry time than the other. I applied this foundation with both a brush and a sponge and found the sponge gave a much smoother look. The finish is definitely dewy but it doesn\\'t feel heavy or oily. It does cling somewhat to imperfections in my skin (dry patches & blemishes) but it definitely doesn\\'t look as bad as many other similarly priced foundations in that respect. I would say this is buildable but I found a little went a long way with this foundation and it has more initial coverage than their total control foundation.

It reminds me of the finish of the it cosmetics cc cream but it\\\\\\'s thinner in consistency. I like to apply this with my fingers.

This does t go on super glory but becomes more radiant as the day goes on. It seems to keep my skin looking blurred as it wears away throughout the day... so it still looks nice. I think it\\'s a great affordable option for people with dry skin who want a medium coverage. \\\\n\\\\nI received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \"I\\'ll start by saying I like the packaging it comes in. Very easy to squeeze it out to get just the right amount, instead of pouring and getting too much. Plus it\\'d be easy to travel with. Upon applying to the skin I noticed it was very easy to blend in. Very creamy and gives a nice medium to full coverage. My skin looked slightly dewy or glowy without looking greasy/shiny. Perfect for those like me with dry skin. Sometimes if I\\'m having a bad skin day it does tend to accentuate some texture, but most the time it looks great. Overall I like and will continue to use it. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \"I love this product! I got introduced to it by this app and once I got it, I started using it almost every single day ! It\\'s coverage is full but it\\'s not so cakey on the face which I love. It leaves your face looking more radiant after you put it on and I overall recommend it\", \\'Ntx is one of my favorite brands. Their products are always very high quality and affordable.

I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\\', \"I don\\'t feel that this lived up to any of the claims\", \\'I do not like the way this applies to my skin. It was Sri and cakey at the same time.

It is not heavy but instead light and leaves your skin feeling open and not like make up is caked on.\\', \"I liked the packaging, I think it looked cute and sleek fora drug store brand. This product is good for dry skin or combination, very light weight and easy to apply. Sometimes I like to add this to another foundation to give me a beautiful glow or if I want to give myself a natural glow. It\\'s a great product and I think it\\'s worth trying out. I did receive this product for free.\", \\'Unfortunately, this broke me out. The coverage was nice. I loved the finish. It was affordable. But the ingredients are pretty questionable. Talc, for one. Denatured alcohol - which is very damaging to your skin and will actually age you - is another.\\', \"Love that it\\'s so convenient to buy at stores not just online. Very affordable.

This will be a product I add into my daily routine!!\", \"Unfortunately was sent a color that is deeper than my skin tone so was not able to test on my face. But, I did test it on the back of my hand and I will say that it is very easy to blend! Also that it has nice light to medium coverage so if you\\'re looking for something more natural then this is it! its also buildable so i\\'m sure you can get a full coverage look. As for the glow aspect, it\\'s very dewy but not to the point where you look greasy. It\\'s natural and it stays put! ♡ I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \\'Great for long wesr\\', \"I\\'m going to start by saying I LOVE the range of shades you can get with this NYX foundation. When I used it for the first time, it didn\\'t feel heavy or cakey in any way. It blended so easily and had just the right amount of coverage. It is definitely radiant and glowy as advertised, yet not so much as to where it would make your skin look oily. It gives you a natural looking glow with good coverage overall. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great foundation that won\\'t let you down or break the bank. \\\\nI received this product complimentary from Influensterr for testing purposes.\", \"This has honestly become one of my favorite every day foundations. It\\'s a buildable foundation which I really like. It\\'s also very light weight so it doesn\\'t feel like I\\'m wearing much product. I normally use cushion foundations as an every day foundation but this is so good that I stopped using cushion foundations. The only con I have is the smell but I\\'ve had foundations that smell like paint so it\\'s not such a big deal. So happy I was able to test out this foundation. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \"This is definitely glowy! Sort of hard to blend out, I used a beauty blender and kept getting patches. The shade I got is also super light but nothing bronzer couldn\\'t fix! I won\\'t use as much next time for a more sheer coverage to see how I like that! I may have to get another shade. Stayed very tacky so I had to set it which took away from the glow. I also picked a 90 degree day to wear it so I will certainly be trying it again! I was surprised how well it wore thru the day, sweating and all! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \"I was excited to learn I was receiving this product complimentary, the color match was perfect and I tried it out for a little over a week; and noticed that this foundation, is not the one for my skin. I can get oily so I also made sure to apply primer as well as setting powder but along with the summer heat this foundation did not cut it for even a few hours. It would start separating leaving some spots on my face and it\\'s a creamy buildable foundation but it won\\'t be there for you in the long haul. You will need to touch up I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \\'I received this NYX Born to Glow foundation in Warm Vanilla for free for review. The packaging is cute and shows the color of the foundation well. Upon opening, I found that the formula was very fluid. I applied one coat with a beauty blender to ensure even coverage. Once applied, I found the formula somewhat greasy and it moved on my skin. It settled in the creases on my forehead and the color appeared chalky- potentially just an error in color choice for my skin. It did prove to be buildable but the consistency was not desirable. Over all, I would not purchase or use again. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\\', \"If you want a full coverage this won\\'t be it. But if you want something light for summer or on a day you don\\'t want to do full makeup this is great! It smooths out really well and doesn\\'t leave your face too shinny\", \"First off, the shade range on this line is really great! A little goes a long way with this product in terms of giving me a radiant glow without being too dewy. Definitely light to medium in the coverage area, but I like that this foundation is perfect for those everyday summer looks where you don\\'t need full coverage. If I use a little too much foundation it can look cakey up close, so I have to say that I haven\\'t quite found the perfect primer for this foundation yet (combo skin). I\\'m going to keep trying because I do like the way this gives me a nice radiant glow.\", \"First off I was surprised about how much coverage this foundation has. It\\'s fairly liquidy and doesn\\'t feel heavy on the face at all. This shade was slightly more yellow tone that I expected but with bronzer etc it works just fine. Overall it\\'s long lasting and lasts all day. I would definitely buy this again. Thankfully I received this for testing purposes  but now I love a product I probably wouldn\\'t have given a chance.\", \\'I think this foundation is pretty nice especially for the price. It has a nice coverage that is buildable without being too heavy. I was very pleasantly surprised when it matched my skin tone as a lot of drugstore foundations are too dark or too yellow.

It goes on like a liquid, and is easy to apply. The first time I used it, I squirted too much out. You really do not need to use much to get good coverage. The one thing I didn\\'t like was how it left a powdery look on some places. This was very easy to fix, by a small amount of blending. Once I was finished applying, I couldn\\'t feel it on. Overall, for the price, this is a good value. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \\'This foundation is super thin and liquidy. The coverage is nice and buildable. I would say medium coverage. Definitely for someone with skin on the dryer side. I was surprised that this matched my skin tone perfectly. It was really easy to blend out and sits nice on the skin.

I loved the glowiness it added to my complexion  and I could wear it all the time without causing breakouts. It didnt sit in my creases and made my face look so smooth! The packaging was great to control how much comes out and to see how much is left. It is the perfect medium coverage foundation.\\', \\'This is great with a brush! Or for a more buildable and flawless look, use a beauty sponge to apply the foundation!

I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\", \"** I received this product free/complimentary for testing purposes ** with that being said, I absolutely love this foundation! I\\'m always looking for glowy foundations since I have fairly dry skin and love to look dewy. I love the fact that it has the jojoba oil and vitamin e in it as well, so that it\\'s hydrating while still giving nice coverage! The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the packaging. I love the squeeze tube, however, I feel that this foundation is extremely liquidy and hard to control how much you squeeze out when you go to use it.\", \"This product was very nice medium coverage and light weight that felt really nice on the skin. The color match wasn\\'t perfect for me. It was very warm for the neutral tan shade.\", \"I really wanted to like this foundation, it just wasn\\'t working amazing for me.the color was a little too light for me and I wasn\\'t loving the coverage. The first day I tried it without primer, to see how it performed without and to see what kind of primer would be best. It sank right into my pores. I tried it with a brush (my go to method for more water foundations) and it was too thick in the brush. It still sank into pores with my shape tape primer. Using my elf mineral infused primer and wet and wild primer water worked best when using a sponge. Because the color was light for me, I needed to apply bronzer/contour to my face to even it out. It\\'s more than I like to wear in the summer. I am going to try it again in the winter to see if I like it then. It\\'s not a bad foundation and I may like it better when it matches. I just like what I currently use more. \\\\n\\\\nI have combo skin, and larger pores on/around my nose (where it sunk in). This was sent me this for free for an honest review.\", \"This foundation has become one of my favorite everyday foundations ! It\\'s last a really long time before it start to break up. I have dry to oily skin I\\'m dry all around and in my t-zone very oily and it looks amazing, I do get a little shiny but not so much where its unwearable. My favorite thing about this is that 1 it\\'s in a Squeezy tube and 2 a little goes a long way it\\'s light to medium coverage it\\'s buildable doesn\\'t cake up or anything so if you want you can go full coverage but might take a few layer. Overall I give it a 10/10 will be purchasing once I run out. I\\'ve also recommended this to a friend who loves it and she has very dry skin and she loves it.\", \"I love this foundation!  Nyx really knocked it out of the park with this foundation!  My skin looks amazing and feels amazing with this foundation on. It\\'s feet but not in the sweaty or greasy way!  It\\'s a very healthy glow. The shade I got was a little too light so I\\'ve been using it as concealer until the right shade comes in that I ordered. I\\'m really loving it. It\\'s not creasing and it\\'s making my skin look sooo good!  I recommend this foundation for sure!  Nyx has really stepped up the game for low cost foundation.

You have to have a good base primer underneath to keep it from slipping around,also I found I had to set my whole face with powder to keep it from moving! The shade I received is not my summer shade it\\'s definitely my winter shade as it\\'s very light! This shade has good neutral undertones not to yellow not to pink so it would work for a lot of people! It is very smooth once applied and last at least 8hrs on me!

I totally loved the satin finish. Easy application with a beauty blender which I loved because I do not care for using a brush. I did set this makeup with the ELF dewy setting spray after my typical makeup routine. Very lightweight feeling which is nice with this summer heat. Makeup did hold up well throughout the day. The only downside is that when I tried to build coverage it seemed cakey and cracked after a few hours of wear. So if you are looking for a buildable fuller coverage this is not it. I like a lighter coverage and this totally works for me. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.\\', \"I liked it but I\\'m used to wearing more of a bb cream so it was too much for me.\", \\'This product has an amazing application and looks so light and skin like and has medium to full coverage.\\', \"I\\'ve been using this for a good few weeks now. I\\'ve used it by itself and also mixed in with a moisturizer to sheer it out. This is very pigmented for being such a dewy product. Gives a solid medium buildable coverage.\\\\nIt doesn\\'t feel heavy on the skin and truly gives it a gorgeous healthy looking glow. It does settle a little bit into my fine lines and also tends to oxidize so i like to set it with a powder.\\\\nOne big negative for me is that it contains dimethicone which my skin doesn\\'t tolerate so it broke me out. If your skin works with that and you have dry skin then definitely check it out. Performance wise, this is one of the better drugstore foundations I have tried.\", \"I really liked this foundation it has a nice texture and not too dewy. This doesn\\'t cling to any dry patches. I also like mixing this with other foundations it has worked well with all of my other face products.\", \\'Awesome packaging and product. I would recommend not buying online. I received mine complimentary.\\', \\'This foundation is a godsend for me - the color is very similar to the Alabaster Total Control drops, but those were too matte for my dry skin.  With this, I get the same color match (pale, yellow undertone) in a formula much more suited to my skin type.  I would say the coverage is medium, and the finish perfect for dry or combination skin types, and workable for oily skin as well (just be sure to apply a thinner layer on your t-zone to prevent excess oils from interacting with the foundation).
